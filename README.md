# baxter-sagart-old-chinese

A [TSV dump] of the Baxter-Sagart reconstruction of Old Chinese
from [University of Michigan], with minor (whitespace) cleanup.


## Rationale

- Dropbox didn't play nice with my browser.
- Excel as a format is not nice.
- Excel downloads should be [treated with caution].
- Searchable TSVs on GitHub are nice.
